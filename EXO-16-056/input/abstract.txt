Searches are presented for resonances decaying to dijet final states in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\mathrm{TeV}$. A low-mass search, for a resonance mass between 0.6 and 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets reconstructed at the trigger level with calorimeter information, in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $27~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. A high-mass search, for resonances above 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets reconstructed with the particle-flow algorithm in a data set corresponding to $36~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The dijet mass spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no significant evidence for the production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at $95\%$ confidence level are reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string resonances with masses below 7.7 TeV, scalar diquarks below 7.2 TeV, axigluons and colorons below 6.1 TeV, excited quarks below 6.0 TeV, color-octet scalars below $3.4~\mathrm{TeV}$, W$^{\prime}$ bosons below 3.3 TeV, Z$^{\prime}$ bosons below 2.7 TeV, RS gravitons below $1.7~\mathrm{TeV}$ and between 2.1 and 2.5 TeV, and dark matter mediators below 2.6 TeV. The limits on both vector and axial-vector mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter, are also presented as functions of dark matter mass and coupling to quarks. Limits are presented for resonances with intrinsic width as large as $30\%$ of the resonance mass, and are used to improve and extend the exclusions of a dark matter mediator to larger values of mass and coupling.
