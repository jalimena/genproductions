Searches are presented for resonances decaying to dijet final states in proton-proton
collisions at s = 13 TeV. A low-mass search, for a resonance mass between 0.6
and 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets reconstructed at the trigger level with calori-
meter information, in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 27 fb − 1 .
A high-mass search, for resonances above 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets recon-
structed with the particle-flow algorithm in a data set corresponding to 36 fb − 1 . The
dijet mass spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no sig-
nificant evidence for the production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at
95% confidence level are reported on the production cross section for narrow reso-
nances with masses above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude
string resonances with masses below 7.7 TeV, scalar diquarks below 7.2 TeV, axigluons
and colorons below 6.1 TeV, excited quarks below 6.0 TeV, color-octet scalars below
3.4 TeV, W 0 bosons below 3.3 TeV, Z 0 bosons below 2.7 TeV, RS gravitons below 1.7 TeV
and between 2.1 and 2.5 TeV, and dark matter mediators below 2.6 TeV. The limits on
both vector and axial-vector mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between
quarks and dark matter, are also presented as functions of dark matter mass and cou-
pling to quarks. Limits are presented for resonances with intrinsic width as large as
30% of the resonance mass, and are used to improve and extend the exclusions of a
dark matter mediator to larger values of mass and coupling.
